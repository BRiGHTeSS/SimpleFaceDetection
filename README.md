# SimpleFaceDetection
<h2>Here this is a Face Detector Program by using images</h2>
<h6>It is the first program in the face detection project's development. This is a simple face detection program using face detection from images.</h6>
<h2>So, how to create this program!?</h2>
<h4>This program uses a library called OpenCV. the most popular library for basic image processing such as blurring, blending, and image enhancement. to increase video quality Recognizing objects in images or detecting faces or objects in images and videos and using an algorithm called "haarcascade", which is an object detection algorithm used to detect objects in real-time. And it is One of the popular algorithms for facial detection is "haarcascade". It is computationally less expensive, has a fast algorithm, and gives high accuracy.</h4>
